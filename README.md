## Prerequisites

This action requires:

* Synadia NGS account. A [Developer account](https://synadia.com/ngs/pricing) will suffice to use the action.

* The credentials for a NGS account user. They are the inputs to the action. See [Credentials](#credentials) below for more information about
creating a user and getting the credentials.


## Usage

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Send event
    uses: tryggth/ngs-docker-action@v0.2
    with:
      subject: GA
      user: ${{ secrets.NGS_USER }}
      seed: ${{ secrets.NGS_USER_SEED }}
```

## Inputs

| Name          | Requirement | Default | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `subject`| _optional_ | `GA` | NATS subject |
| `user`| required`|  _none_ |  USER NKEY SEED See [Credentials](#credentials) |

### Metadata customizations

You can store your service specification in a YAML file. This will allow for
further service configuration, such as [memory limits](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/memory-limits),
[CPU allocation](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/cpu),
[max instances](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/max-instances),
and [more](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/run/deploy#OPTIONAL-FLAGS).
**Other inputs will be overridden when using `metadata`**

- See [Deploying a new service](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying#yaml)
to create a new YAML service definition, for example:

```YAML
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: SERVICE
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: IMAGE
```

- See [Deploy a new revision of an existing service](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying#yaml_1)
to generated a YAML service specification from an existing service:

```
gcloud run services describe SERVICE --format yaml > service.yaml
```

## Outputs

- `none`

## Credentials

There are a few ways to authenticate this action. A service account will be needed with the following roles:

- Cloud Run Admin (`roles/run.admin`):
  - Can create, update, and delete services.
  - Can get and set IAM policies.

## Example Workflows

* [Deploy a prebuilt container](#deploy-a-prebuilt-container)

* [Build and deploy a container](#build-and-deploy-a-container)

### Setup

1.  Create a new Google Cloud Project (or select an existing project).

1. [Enable the Cloud Run API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=run.googleapis.com).

1.  [Create a Google Cloud service account][sa] or select an existing one.

1.  Add the the following [Cloud IAM roles][roles] to your service account:

    - `Cloud Run Admin` - allows for the creation of new Cloud Run services

    - `Service Account User` -  required to deploy to Cloud Run as service account

    - `Storage Admin` - allow push to Google Container Registry (this grants project level access, but recommend reducing this scope to [bucket level permissions](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/access-control#grant).)

1.  [Download a JSON service account key][create-key] for the service account.

1.  Add the following [secrets to your repository's secrets][gh-secret]:

    - `GCP_PROJECT`: Google Cloud project ID

    - `GCP_SA_KEY`: the downloaded service account key

### Deploy a prebuilt container

To run this [workflow](.github/workflows/example-workflow-quickstart.yaml), push to the branch named `example-deploy`:

```sh
git push YOUR-FORK main:example-deploy
```

### Build and deploy a container

To run this [workflow](.github/workflows/example-workflow.yaml), push to the branch named `example-build-deploy`:

```sh
git push YOUR-FORK main:example-build-deploy
```

**Reminder: If this is your first deployment of a service, it will reject all unauthenticated requests. Learn more at [allowing unauthenticated requests](#Allow-unauthenticated-requests)**
